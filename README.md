# investment-simulator
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a team project for my master graduation. It is about to provide investment newbies with a simulating environment to practice. 
The platform provides real-time stock infromation searching and trend details retriving. Also, the platform offers features to track and analyse personal stock trading.

In other words, users can create their virtual account to simulate exactly the same stock trading from the real world without risking their money. 
They can collect stocks they are interested in and can simulate stock trading to see if they could invest successfully or not. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
My team consist of five members and all have our own roles. I was the scrum master of the team taking charging of the progress management and system architecture building.

The project was implemented by using Django MVT structure, front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, jQuery and e-chart, 
and few third-party APIs like Finnhub Stock API, Django-apscheduler(for real-time stock information retrive and periodical stock information storage and update). 
Several screeshots about the project would be presented below
